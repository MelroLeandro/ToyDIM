# ToyDIM
A library of MATLAB tools  used to simulate the dynamic behavior of a rigid and flexible body system with arbitrary topology.

Metodology

     The methodology used for rigid multibody systems dynamics follows (Parviz E. Nikravesh 1989), using a Augmented Lagrange Formulation and the DIM. To descibe large relative rotations in deformable systems a finite element representation of each flexible component is used following the methodolgy presented by Jorge Ambrosio in DSM2007.

Current Features

The following components of a multibody system are currently supported:

Bodies:
     rigid 
     flexible

Joints

    Spherical
    Revolute
    Rigid

Force types

    Spring force

Force Elements

    Gravity
    Translational (The mentioned force types are applied along the line connecting two points)


Simulation results: Propagation of

    All body coordinates, their first and second derivatives
    The Jacobian and Lagrange multiplies of the position constraints
    The constraint and joint reaction forces acting on the bodies centers of mass
    The applied forces acting on the bodies centers of mass
    The output values of all user-defined functions
